KafkaWriter(brokerURL, topic)
Creates and returns a *KafkaProducer that wraps a configured kafka.Writer.
kafka.TCP(brokerURL) instructs the writer which broker address to dial (host:port).
Topic is where messages will be written.
Balancer: &kafka.LeastBytes{} chooses the partition with the least bytes (a load-balancing strategy).
RequiredAcks: kafka.RequireAll tells Kafka to wait for acknowledgements from all replicas (strong durability).

/*
x := 10       // x holds the value 10
p := &x       // p holds the address of x (like a pointer to x)
fmt.Println(p)  // prints something like 0xc0000140a8 (the memory address)
fmt.Println(*p) // prints 10 (value at that address)

üìò Analogy:
x is the actual data (a value stored in memory).
p is the pointer, which tells you where that data lives.
*p means ‚Äúgo to that address and read the value‚Äù.*/
